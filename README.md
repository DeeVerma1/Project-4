## The work

For this project, you will be doing work that focuses on social impact.

The prompts are there to help jump-start your ideation process. If you would like to change or combine prompts, that's fine! If you want to find your own idea, even better. **Consult your instructors for final approval before getting started.**  

Remember to start with a good problem statement!

## Requirements
This project will be hosted on **GitHib**, not just GA's GitHub Enterprise, so it will be a public project for your portfolio and will add to your github activity.  For the purposes of a DSI project, you must meet a few technical requirements. They are:
1)  A `README.md` file in your project repo. Note that `README` files are automatically rendered by GitHub when you view a repo. Your README should contain:
    - A problem statement.
    - A succinct formulation of the question your analysis seeks to answer.
    - A table of contents, which should indicate which notebook or scripts a stakeholder should start with, and a link to an **executive summary**.
    - A paragraph description of the data you used, plus your data acquisition, ingestion, and cleaning steps.
    - A short description of software requirements (e.g., `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`) required by your analysis.

2) Your notebook(s) should be **reproducible** and **error-free**. This means:
    - You should set a random seed at the start of every notebook. This will ensure that the random numbers generated in your notebook will be the same every time.
    - You need to provide a _relative path_ to your data, so that if I clone your repo to my machine I can run everything in your repo without error. (You also provide links to any publicly accessible data.)
    - I should be able to `Restart & Run All` in your notebook(s) and see that the _exact same_ results are reproduced.
    - To check that everything worked properly, you may consider forking your own repo to a different location on your computer and checking that all notebooks can run properly from top to bottom.

3) Bear in mind that the value you provide may come from data ingestion, data cleaning, EDA, and/ or a dashboard, etc. While a model may not be immediately apparent, be creative. *Without us telling you exactly what model to build, how could you build a model to increase performance or generate better insights when answering the problem you are facing?*

### Teams

Your instructors will divide your class into teams based on interests. Chat with them to find out more!

---

### Presentations

Each group will present their findings.

Your presentation must include:
- A summary of the problem you tackled.
- A walkthrough of how you set out to solve the problem.
- A demonstration of your solution. (i.e. You may demonstrate an app you developed, an example of how a model may be used, etc.)
- A summary of any models you fit and, if applicable, their performance.
- A brief discussion of limitations to your process. (i.e. data collection issues, missing values)
- A brief discussion of next steps.

Presentation requirements:
- *Consider the audience!*
- *As with presentations in the "real world," there is no required time limit.* Your presentation should be long enough to cover all relevant aspects of the problem, but not so long that it obscures the takeaways of the presentation. (Your group should likely aim for somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, but it is possible that you may need a different amount of time for your presentation.)
- Your presentation must include slides. (Google Slides, PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.)
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Make sure you provide clear conclusions/recommendations that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.
