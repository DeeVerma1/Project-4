## Problem Statement

COVID-19 has been with us for 2 years now, with most people fully vaccinated and boosted in some states, while less so in others, theoretically making this segment of the population more vulnerable to infection and hospitalization. While we are not domain experts in epidemiology, health authorities, aware of their own biases and mindsets, sought a different perspective by tasking us (as data scientists/analysts) with drawing insight from covid-19 vaccination/surveillance and/or demographic data to inform resource allocation decisions, such as:

1. where to distribute covid anti-viral therapeutics, 
2. where to focus education campaigns, 
3. recommendations on improving the healthcare access points etc to prevent future surges, hospitalizations, and deaths. 
We will examine the following datasets XXXXX, for insight into these questions.

We will be conducting thorough exploratory data analysis to find patterns and correlation between different parameters such as hospitalization rates, vaccination rates, education level/campaign frequency etc. as well as healthcare access/COVID clinics etc. by location.

This project also aims to use LR models to make some predictions and inferences, as well as time series model to make some future prediction on hospitalization rates translating into recommendations for anti-viral therapeutics.

* Caveat: we are not domain experts in this field

## Data Acquisition

We used the following COVID-19 datasets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for our analysis:
* [`covid_surveillance.csv`](./data/covid_surveillance.csv):  (link to a data dictionary.txt)
    This dataset includes entries for xxx

* [`covid_vaccination_trends.csv`](./data/covid_vaccination_trends.csv):  
    This dataset includes entries for xxx
